# Web 3.O
Web3.O website using Ethereum Blockchain and react-js

Project Name: KRYPT (EthMarket)
Tagline: Bridging E-commerce Web3.O website using Ethereum Blockchain and react-js 

Problems it solves:

Lack of transparency and trust in traditional e-commerce: EthMarket leverages the Ethereum blockchain to provide immutable records of transactions, ensuring transparency and enhancing trust between buyers and sellers.
High fees and delays in payment processing: By utilizing Ethereum's smart contract capabilities, EthMarket streamlines payment processes, reducing fees and eliminating delays associated with traditional payment gateways.
Limited accessibility to global markets: EthMarket opens up global markets to both buyers and sellers by leveraging the decentralized nature of blockchain technology, enabling seamless transactions across borders.

Challenges we ran into:

Integration with Ethereum blockchain: Ensuring seamless interaction between the web platform and the Ethereum blockchain posed challenges in terms of data synchronization, security, and transaction handling.
Scalability: Scaling the platform to accommodate a growing user base while maintaining performance and efficiency required careful planning and optimization.
User experience: Balancing the complexities of blockchain technology with a user-friendly interface presented challenges in designing an intuitive and accessible platform for users with varying levels of technical expertise.

Technologies we used:

Ethereum blockchain: Smart contracts written in Solidity for handling transactions and business logic on the blockchain.
React.js: Front-end development framework for building the user interface and ensuring a responsive and dynamic user experience.
Web3.js: JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain from the web application, facilitating communication with smart contracts and retrieving blockchain data.
IPFS (InterPlanetary File System): Decentralized storage protocol used for storing product images, descriptions, and other data to ensure resilience and availability.
polygon blockchain: Smart contracts written in Solidity for handling transactions and business logic on the matic blockchain.
Metamask: Ethereum wallet browser extension utilized for secure authentication and transaction signing within the web application.
